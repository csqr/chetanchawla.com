title: Claudius on Wits
---

I have survived to middle age with half my wits while thousands have died with all of theirs intact, evidently quality of wits is more important than quantity.

--[Claudius Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius)

PS: I highly recommend the TV series [I, Claudius](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/) starring Derek Jacobi, excellent for fans of historical TV series.
