    "कर्मण्ये वाधिकारस्ते म फलेषु कदाचना
    कर्मफलेह्तुर भुरमा ते संगोस्त्वकर्मानी॥
    
-- Bhagavad Gita, Ch 2., Verse 47.
Translation from [Srimad Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sri Sankaracharya](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8178235072/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=8178235072&linkCode=as2&tag=chechablo-20&linkId=FNGTSKA47H7DB3KR)

"You have right only to perform work and not to undertake the discipline of knowledge. While doing works, do not think you have the right to claim their fruits. Never, in any state of life whatsoever, should you crave for the fruits of your works – this is the idea. When you crave for the fruits of your works, you make yourself liable to reap those fruits; (but) you should never be the cause of such fruit-gathering, for when one works, impelled by the craving for fruits, one has to reap the fruits of such works, namely, birth in the world. ‘If the fruits of works are not to be desired, why should painful works be undertaken at all?’ This thought should not tempt you, Arjuna, to withdraw from all works, either."
