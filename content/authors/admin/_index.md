I am a teacher, researcher, and consultant of business strategy, and entrepreneurship. I have 10+ years of business consulting experience with clients ranging from Fortune 100 defense companies to Indian retailers, and technology startups.

My academic research focus is the association between capital providers (debt, equity, and non-traditional forms of financing e.g. crowdfunding) and startup outcomes. More specifically, I investigate the capital provider and startup linkage in contexts ranging from S & P 500 companies to cryptocurrency, blockchain projects, and other early-stage ventures.

My academic teaching focus is strategy, and entrepreneurship.

I am an [Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship](https://www.northcentralcollege.edu/profile/cchawla) at North Central College in Naperville, IL in the School of Business and Entrepreneurship.
